This is my first year participating and on whim I've decided to let RNG choose the language I would use, and so C++ it is. As a side note I'll add that at the start of this year advent of code my opinions and experience of C++ are non-existent.

### Live Reactions:

> Also, part 2 was evil...

> Day 2 - Hmmm, it is currently ugly and I have no idea if it's any "good" but hey, its just day 2 and i'm not drowning in documentation tabs anymore, progress! 

> Day 3 - Horrible, terrible, disguting code, i give up, can't find the edge case that is throwing the answer off and this monstrosity i've created is not helping.
