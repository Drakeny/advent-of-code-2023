This is my first year participating and on whim I've decided to let RNG choose the language I would use, and so C++ it is. As a side note I'll add that at the start of this year advent of code my opinions and experience of C++ are non-existent.

### Live Reactions:
> Day 1 - Oh no, what did I get myself into...
>
> Also, part 2 was evil...

> Day 2 - Hmmm, it is currently ugly and I have no idea if it's any "good" but hey, its just day 2 and i'm not drowning in documentation tabs anymore, progress! 

> Day 3 - Horrible, terrible, disguting code, i give up, can't find the edge case that is throwing the answer off and this monstrosity i've created is not helping. 

> Day 4 - Huh, part 1 was a breeze, i had to rewrite for part 2 and created another monster, this time i can safely say it was language unfamiliarity.

> Day 5 - Part 1 was fairly straight forward, part 2 on the other hand, turned into brute force fest, but the "solution" was done right after part 1, BUT it had a off by 1 and all the time to brute force made it take way too much time.

> Day 6 - Well this was easy...
